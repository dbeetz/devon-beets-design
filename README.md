Devon Beets Design PWP

## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case are all clearly defined and well done. Your HTML is excellent, and your directory structure is spot on. Nice job.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). We will cover Milestone 2 in class tomorrow, but go ahead and get started on the reading if you like:  [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/)

## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Really nice work here - the scope you have outlined is perfect for PWP, and your content strategy and wireframes are very well done. 

The web formatted resume may be a tricky fit on a one-page layout - I would aim to both simplify and clarify the content there, with an eye to minimize the content where necessary. Also, I am thinking that a simple presentation way do well to highlight the content well. If the content you plan to feature here, along with a portfolio, becomes lengthy - I would consider a second page. One page layouts can become overwhelmed with too much content fast. 

I'd like to hear more about your ideas for the collapsing sections. Be very careful on how this functionality will affect the mobile layout. My first thought is to disable it on mobile, but of course experiment and see what works best for your layout design. I would advise simplicity over complexity at this stage.

I think you have some very cool ideas here and I'm excited to see them take shape. We will cover basic JavaScript this week, but I would encourage you to investigate jQuery further as it is the defacto JS library for creating interactive UI. We will also be using jQuery to validate the contact form as well. Admittedly, our jQuery coverage is light in this class, but if you have a good grasp of basic JS and CSS syntax, it's actually a breeze.

One thought I do have is to have the Resume link in your main nav send the user to the Resume section as opposed to being a download link. 

Have a look at the [Bootstrap Form](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms) documentation and the accompanying HTML structure. Bootstrap will give your forms a huge head start in regards to style and accessibility, but a more specific HTML structure is required.

Overall, very nice work here. Everything is well done. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric) You are clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- The &lt;html&gt; tag is closed prematurely on line 7. Also, watch indentation.
- Have a look at [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for free iconography. Useful for social media links.
